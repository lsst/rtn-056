First, I want to thank the entire RECA internship program team, who saw the need for this program and made the possible growth in research Colombia's students, providing a great learning experience, both computational and observational. To LSSST Corporation, which financed the realization of this project. To my advisers, Drs. Andrés M. Plazas \& Craig Lage, who were the guide throughout this learning process, were willing to answer any questions and shared a little about their lives, making a closer relationship despite the virtuality. Finally, thanks to my colleague Jerónimo Calderón for the discussions, and feedback throughout the project.
